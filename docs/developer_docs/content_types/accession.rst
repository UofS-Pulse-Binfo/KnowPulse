Germplasm Accession
====================

These are currently customized stock pages managed by the Tripal Germplasm module. Stored in the Chado Stock table broken out by type_id.

Overview
--------

- Basic information such as name, accession, what-not. This will remain a default Tripal pane  
- It would be great to finally have the breeder short-hand for the pedigree! This could be a separate field from the pedigree diagram so I can put it in the overview.

Pedigree
--------

- Shows the parentage pedigree diagram with all but the first 3 levels collapsed.
- All diagrams should now include a figure legend.

Genotypes Pane
---------------

- Types: This field summarizes the number of markers per type with calls for the current germplasm.
- Genotypes Search: Redirects to the genotype matrix pre-filtered for the current germplasm. Provides form elements to further restrict the matrix.

Breeding Markers
----------------

- List the calls for a set of CORE breeding markers. Make the set configurable at the field level.

Phenotypes Pane
----------------

- List the value for a set of CORE phenotypes (e.g. seed coat, cotyledon color). Make the set configurable at the field level. Should it be entereable on the form? How do we handle multiple experiments, siteyears for a single trait/variety combo.
