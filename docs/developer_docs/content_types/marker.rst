===============

The genetic marker page is currently a customized feature page. Stored in the Chado Feature table broken out by type_id.

Overview
---------

- Meta-data
    - Name
    - Marker technology
    - Species
    - Gene name and location in gene (if within gene) 
    - any additional meta-data helpful for running the marker (e.g. primers)
