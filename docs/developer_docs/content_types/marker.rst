Genetic Marker
===============

The genetic marker page is currently a customized feature page. Stored in the Chado Feature table broken out by type_id.

Overview
---------

- Meta-data
    - Name
    - Marker technology
    - Species
    - ``@todo`` Gene name and location in gene (if within gene) 
    - ``@todo`` any additional meta-data helpful for running the marker (e.g. primers)

Marker Locations
------------------

- marker locations by assembly (``@todo`` not yet by assembly)

Genotypic Data
---------------

- pie chart summarizing the known alleles
- ``@todo`` Genotype look-up field: mini genotype matrix for a single variant. Germplasm are the rows.
- ``@todo`` Genotypes Matrix Link: Redirects to the genotype matrix pre-filtered for the current marker.

Sequence
---------

- Variant Marked-up Sequence (FASTA format) (``@todo`` -state assembly?) for all locations

Genome View
------------

- ``@todo`` JBrowse field located on this marker

Genetic Maps
----------------

- ``@todo`` List all the genetic maps containing this marker

QTL
