Cultivated Variety
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Stored in the Chado Stock table broken out by type_id. See https://www.crop-diversity.org/mgis/accession/01BEL084245 

Overview
--------

- Basic information such as name, accession, what-not. This will remain a default Tripal pane  
- It would be great to finally have the breeder short-hand for the pedigree! This could be a separate field from the pedigree diagram so I can put it in the overview.
- specific variety information
- link to registration pub
- abstract from pub

Parental Pedigree
------------------

- Shows the parentage pedigree diagram with all but the first 3 levels collapsed.
- All diagrams should now include a figure legend.

Genotypes Pane
---------------

- Types: This field summarizes the number of markers per type with calls for the current germplasm.
- Genotype Look-up field: a mini-genotype matrix filtered to this germplasm only. User enters a marker or region to display.
- Genotype Matrix Link: Redirects to the genotype matrix pre-filtered for the current germplasm.

Breeding Markers
----------------

- List the calls for a set of CORE breeding markers. Make the set configurable at the field level.

Phenotypes Pane
----------------

- List the value for a set of CORE phenotypes (e.g. seed coat, cotyledon color). Make the set configurable at the field level. Should it be entereable on the form? How do we handle multiple experiments, siteyears for a single trait/variety combo.
- Phenotype pane should highlight phenotypes specifically of interest for this cultivar.

Relationships
--------------

- list any non-parental/progeny relationships.
