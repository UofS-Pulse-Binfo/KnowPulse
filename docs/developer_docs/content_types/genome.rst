Genome Project
==============

The plan is to store the genome assembly as collection of analysis records (one for each program ran to create the assembly) grouped together by this project.

Overview
---------
**Open by Default**

- Publication (prominent) with link

- Meta-data about the assembly

    - Scaffolds: size + number
    - Contigs: size + number
    - Scaffold N50/L50
    - Contig N50/L50

- Meta-data about the annotation

Assembly Details
----------------

- How was the assembly generated?
    
    - paragraph description
    - a list of all the analysis' records with versions, etc.
    
- How was it annotated?

    - paragraph description
    - a list of all the analysis' records with versions, etc.

Contacts
---------

  - List of contacts for who will answer questions

Whole Genome Browsing
----------------------
**Open by Default**

- Genome Browser

    - summarize the data in the current JBrowse
    - have an image linking to the JBrowse instance for this assembly

- Whole-Genome Diagram

    - show an embedded CViTjs diagram summarizing this assemblyâ€™s annotation and markers.

BLAST Search
-------------

  - BLAST quick search where database is this assembly
  
Bulk Data
----------

  - Files for download associated with this genome

Restrictions on dataset usage
------------------------------
**Open by Default**

  - any agreements, etc.
