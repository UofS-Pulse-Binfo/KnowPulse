Breeding Cross
==============

Stored in the Chado Stock table broken out by type_id.

Overview
--------

- Basic information such as name, accession, what-not. This will remain a default Tripal pane  
- Overview will include information about the crossing block
- It would be great to finally have the breeder short-hand for the pedigree! This could be a separate field from the pedigree diagram so I can put it in the overview.

Crossing Block
---------------

- year, season, 
- number of crosses made in the same crossing block

Parental Pedigree
------------------

- Shows the parentage pedigree diagram with all but the first 3 levels collapsed.
- All diagrams should now include a figure legend.

Progeny
--------

- list of progeny the current cross was a parent for (includes crossing block info).

Genotypes Pane
---------------

- Types: This field summarizes the number of markers per type with calls for the current germplasm.
- Genotype Look-up field: a mini-genotype matrix filtered to this germplasm only. User enters a marker or region to display.
- Genotype Matrix Link: Redirects to the genotype matrix pre-filtered for the current germplasm.

Breeding Markers
----------------

- List the calls for a set of CORE breeding markers. Make the set configurable at the field level.

Phenotypes Pane
----------------

- List the value for a set of CORE phenotypes (e.g. seed coat, cotyledon color). Make the set configurable at the field level. Should it be entereable on the form? How do we handle multiple experiments, siteyears for a single trait/variety combo.

Relationships
--------------

- list any non-parental/progeny relationships.
